### Hack@UCF
[Hack@UCF][hucf] is a computer and information security club. The club features both an offensive and defensive security teams that compete in Capture the Flag competitions around the world, and have quickly established themselves as one of the top undergraduate contenders in the nation. The club features weekly meetings where the leaders talk about current security topics, and occassionally bring in speakers from the industry to give talks. In addition to this, there is a weekly workshop of 3-5 hours where the operations team is able to take a more hands-on approach to teaching security concepts from the ground up.

These workshops have been incredibly useful in teaching the ins and outs of computer security, and especially from a perspective I never received during school. I will be including some of the more interesting projects I've worked on throughout these workshops in this repository.
